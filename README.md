# AWS
Hi! Welcome to my repository "AWS" which contains some AWS projects that I have created and scaled to production in my short, short tenure of 2 years of working with AWS.

It contains the following at the moment :

1. A lambda to monitor long running EMR clusters and sending out alerts if it crosses threashhold.
